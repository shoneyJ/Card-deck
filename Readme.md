### Task 1: Create a shuffled deck of cards

Each card shows a number from 1 to 10. Each number is in the deck four times for a total of 40 cards. At the
beginning of the game, the deck is shuffled (Hint: Look up Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm) to
make sure it is in a random order. Each player receives a stack of 20 cards from the shuffled deck as their
draw pile. The draw pile is kept face-down in front of the player. Each player also keeps a discard pile (see
"Task 3" for more). Tests:

1. A new deck should contain 40 cards
2. A shuffle function should shuffle a deck Hint: Consider mocking Math.random() or the equivalent of your chosen language
